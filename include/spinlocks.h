 * File: spinlocks.h
 * Version: v1.0.0
 * Owner: David William Bull
 * Created: 2026-08-11
 * Last Modified: 2026-08-11
 * Description: User-space spin locks for x86-64 MSVC builds: three acquisition profiles, try-acquire, and full-barrier release.
 * To Do: 1) Tune backoff and yield thresholds per CPU architecture; record results in bench/ per bd1.
 *        2) Add optional acquisition timeout and debug-build deadlock detection.
 *        3) Add a cache-line-padded lock type for lock arrays, to prevent false sharing.
 * Dependencies: typedefs.h, windows.h, intrin.h
 * ISA: AVX2
 * Thread-safety: MT-safe
 * Reviewers: David William Bull
